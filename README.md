Adds a few new buttons to the Social page to make VRChat a better game.


New features:
 - Adds a button that opens a user in the Quick Menu from the Social Menu page
 - Adds a button that allows you to get the avatars author from the Social Menu page

Note: This needs UIExpansionKit (https://github.com/knah/VRCMods#uiexpansionkit)
