Adds a "few" new buttons to the Social page to make VRChat more convenient


New features, a button that:
 - opens a user in the Quick Menu from the Social Menu page
 - gets the avatars author from the Social Menu page and also one for the avatar menu
 - opens a user's world in the world menu (if you join their world)
 - shows you the bio of the selected user (bio is different from status)
 - opens the links a the selected user has in their bio
 - show you the languages a the selected user has in their bio
 - opens the a the selected user in the default browser
 - opens the a the selected user's avatar in the default browser
 (These buttons can also be turned on and off and can always be accessed in a popup attached to the User Details Page)

Note: This needs UIExpansionKit (https://github.com/knah/VRCMods/tree/master/UIExpansionKit)

Also, credits to Ben (https://github.com/BenjaminZehowlt) because I referenced his code a lot to impliment Xref Scanning
